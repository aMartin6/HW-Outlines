# HW 2
## Due Thursday, Feb 1 @ 1pm
Normally you would have a pre-lab due at this time, but the focus of the Turtle lab is coding, not physics, so code practice is our focus.  This is also a great opportunity to approach GitHub another way.

__Bring your laptop to lab tomorrow, if you'd like help to install Anaconda and GitHub Desktop__

### Goals: 
* GitHub
  * Fork the Weekly_Sessions and HW-Outlines repository
  * Modify the Weekly_Session_1.ipynb file 
* Practice the following code concepts using Python 
  * Order of operations
  * Built-in Functions, Packages, and Modules
  * Comments 
  * Control structures
    * If/else

### Intsructions

1.  We did this in class, but I leave this here as a resource:

    Follow the instructions in the GitHub Hello World document: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 
    * make a repository on the Physics-PacU organization named after you - make sure you like this name
    * within that repository, make a new file - call it HW2_ReadingNotes.md
    * Notice it is a ".md" extension.  This stands for Markdown, which is a language in to quickly format documents.  It is the same language you see in Jupyter Notebook cells.
    * Take any reading notes in this file

2.  Do the [Runestone Assignment](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/PHY325/index.html) named HW2

### Reading: 
* GitHub Hello World document: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ (as above)
* Interactive reading in Runestone (as above)
* Newman's __Computational Physics__
  * Section 2.3 - Control Statements If/While
  * Section 2.5 -- Control Statements For Loop
  
We will practice these concepts in lab.  We'll spend more time working with the GitHub workflow.
