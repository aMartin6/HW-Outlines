# HW 2
## Due Thursday, Feb 1 @ 1pm
Normally you would have a pre-lab due at this time, but the focus of the Turtle lab is coding, so this homework involves working our way through Python basics.  This is also a great opportunity to approach GitHub another way.

__Bring your laptop to lab tomorrow, if you'd like help to install Anaconda and GitHub Desktop__

### Goals: 
* GitHub
  * Fork the Weekly_Sessions and HW-Outlines repository
  * Modify the Weekly_Session_1.ipynb file 
* Practice the following code concepts using Python 
  * Order of operations
  * Built-in Functions, Packages, and Modules
  * Comments 
  * Control structures
    * If/else

### Intstructions

1.  Do your reading notes on GitHub in the file HW2_ReadingNotes.md as we discussed in class. If you didn't name it with a ".md" extenstion, you can change it.  Why?  his stands for Markdown, which is a language in to quickly format documents.  It is the same language you see in Jupyter Notebook cells.

   If you need a reminder of what/how we did, see the __Resources__ section below.

2.  Do the [Runestone Assignment](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/PHY325/index.html) named HW2

### Reading: 
* Interactive reading in Runestone (as above - take notes as needed, but don't kill yourself)
* Newman's __Computational Physics__
  * Section 2.3 - Control Statements If/While
  * Section 2.5 -- Control Statements For Loop
  
We will practice these concepts in lab.  We'll spend more time working with the GitHub workflow.

### Resource:
* GitHub Hello World tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ (as above)

#### Make a repo/file on GitHub 
    We did this in class, but I leave this here as a resource, in case you need to make a new repository or file.
    Follow the instructions in the GitHub Hello World document: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 
    * make a repository on the Physics-PacU organization named after you - make sure you like this name
    * within that repository, make a new file - call it HW2_ReadingNotes.md
    * Notice it is a ".md" extension.  This stands for Markdown, which is a language in to quickly format documents.  It is the same language you see in Jupyter Notebook cells.
    * Take any reading notes in this file - *these notes are for you, I look them over and check that you did work that will be useful for you to grow your understanding of python and physics.*
